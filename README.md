[individual rider ranking tables](table-markdown) for each league in the

created using data from [ZwiftPower](https://zwiftpower.com).

Result tables are in the [table-markdown](table-markdown) folder.

## Code

The tables are generated by Python code in a Jupyter notebook.

Those interested can click on the Binder link above to open the interactive
notebook where you can execute the code yourself and play with the
